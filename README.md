# Hybrid Fabrication Platform for Environmental Sensor Enclosures

This repository supports the development of a hybrid fabrication reference platform exploring the use of 3D printing and laser cutting for modular environmental sensor enclosures, with search-and-rescue–inspired and educational use cases.

The project focuses on the physical integration layer of sensing systems—airflow design, material selection, sealing strategies, thermal isolation, and sensor compartmentalization—treating the enclosure itself as a first-order system component that directly influences sensor behavior.

Rather than producing a finished or certified device, this work emphasizes methodology, iteration, and design tradeoffs, making enclosure-driven effects visible, testable, and reproducible.

## Project Scope

- Hybrid enclosure architecture combining 3D-printed structural components with laser-cut internal features  
- Iterative exploration of airflow paths, sensor isolation, and cross-contamination mitigation  
- Multi-material fabrication approaches (rigid structures and flexible sealing elements)  
- Emphasis on fabrication methodology and evaluation rather than operational performance claims  
- Local, transparent data logging for comparative testing and documentation  

This project does not make claims about detection accuracy, operational readiness, or field deployment suitability.

## Development Phases

- **Phases 1–3:**  
  Iterative enclosure design, fabrication, and testing focused on airflow, isolation, and material behavior

- **Phase 4:**  
  Reference platform release with documentation and optional educational support materials

All designs, documentation, and example test protocols are intended to be shared openly.

## Status

This repository is currently a public placeholder created to support project planning and funding review.

No designs, test data, or implementation files are present yet. Content will be added incrementally during development phases if the project proceeds.

## Intended Audience

- Makers exploring hybrid fabrication workflows  
- Educators and students studying enclosure design and sensor integration  
- Researchers interested in physical factors affecting environmental sensing  
- Emergency-response–adjacent communities seeking reference methodologies
